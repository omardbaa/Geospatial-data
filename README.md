# Geospatial-data Project

This project creates an interactive map of any city with marked points of interest (POIs) using Python and various geospatial libraries. The city's geospatial data is obtained from an open-source platform like OpenStreetMap or GeoJSON. Users can explore different POIs, including pharmacies, train stations, educational institutions, mosques, souks, hotels, and gardens, on the interactive map.

**Features:**

- Generate an interactive map of any city with points of interest.
- Visualize different types of points of interest with custom markers and colors.
- Add labels to easily identify each point of interest.
- Calculate the distance between two selected POIs using geodesic distance.
- Explore the geographical separation between different points of interest.

**Getting Started:**

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python libraries using pip.
3. Specify the desired city and region in the code file.
4. Execute the code to generate the interactive map.

**Customization:**

- Customize the types of points of interest and their corresponding icons/colors.
- Modify the map style, zoom level, and initial center.
